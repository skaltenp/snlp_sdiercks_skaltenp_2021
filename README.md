Our name for the GERBIL Fact Checking challenge is: skaltenp_sdiercks (AUC: 0.6336265103056145 in last submission)

## Run code
To run our code there is no preparation needed.
You only have to click the button "Open in Colab" and the run all cells.
Under "Bearbeiten > Notebook-Einstellungen" one can set "Hardwarebeschleuniger" to GPU, to increase the speed.
(To run the GPU-version you need a google colab pro subscription.)
After that the file will be located in the folder "/content/result.tll" in the colab instance.
